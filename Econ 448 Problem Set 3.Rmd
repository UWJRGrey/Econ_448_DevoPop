## Concept Questions

You can submit your answers to these in a separate document from the data questions below or you can use markdown to write equations using similar syntax to LaTex.  (c.f. https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/math)

1.	Consider Weiss’ model of household production in a marriage between two people a and b with wages $w_a$ and $w_b$ (p. 84), but with constant returns to scale in production.  Total household production is $Z=\sqrt{(x_a+x_b)(t_a+t_b)}$ and both partners face the budget constraint $x_i=w_ih_i$ and time constraint $t_i+h_i=1$ for i=a,b.  Solve for Z in the following situations:
	1.1 Household members have different comparative advantages in market work($w_a>w_b$) and the person with the higher market earnings devotes all of her time to market work while the person with lower market earnings devotes all of his time to home production.
	1.2 All household members have the same comparative advantage in market work ($w_a=w_b$) and both partners spend ½ of their time in market work and ½ of their time in home production.

2. How do the gains from marriage differ in problem 1 from the increasing returns to scale situation examined in class?  Be specific about both cases.

3. One version of a family’s common preferences utility function can be 
$U(c_m,c_f )=c_m^\alpha*c_f^{(1-\alpha)}$
Where $c_m$ and $c_f$ are the consumption of the family’s product (Z) for person m and person f, respectively.  
  3.1 If the family wants to choose cm and cf to maximize their utility subject to budget constraint $Z_mf=c_m+c_f$, solve for their optimal choice of consumptions.   
	3.2 Using the results from Weiss’s model (solved in lecture and the reading) that an individual i’s consumption of Z outside of marriage is $\frac{1}{4} w_i$, and the couple’s total married consumption is $max(w_m,w_f)$, find the gains from marriage for both parties if $w_m=w_f=w$ (your answer will be in terms of w and $\alpha$).

4. In a bargaining model of household decision-making, the couple jointly maximizes the following utility function:
$U=[U(C_m)- T_m]*[U(C_f)- T_f]$

    Subject to $Y= C_m+C_f$, where Y is total family income
    
    Person f is the female partner and m is the male partner

    4.1 In Nancy Qian’s paper, which variable in the preceding model changes as a direct                  consequence of an increase in tea prices in China?
    
    4.2 What other model variables will be affected following this change?
    
    4.3 What do Qian’s findings regarding girls’ survival suggest about the female partner’s             preferences in this model?
    
    4.4 How does Qian justify rejecting the unitary model of household decision-making in this             paper?

## Data Analysis Questions

These questions refer to the data set "1% sample Ethiopia ever-married women age 15+" available via the Econ 448 class account from ipums.org (class code is AAP7QS).  Please download the data and answer the following questions.

1. Create a formatted table of summary statistics (mean, std dev, max, min) for all variables that you use in your analysis (Hint: wait until you answer all of the other questions before finalizing this part).

2. Regress child mortality rate on education, include control variables for age, urban residence (create a dummy variable for residence in an urban area), and at least one other control variable of your choosing.  Tell me why you included that control variable and what you expect the sign to be for the the coefficients on that control variable.

3. Display your regression results from 2 in a table.  Label your variables in the table and give your table a title.  Were the signs on the coefficients as expected? 

4. Now use your regression with control variables as a basis for a plot of the coefficients of CMR on mother's education, by years of education.  Include standard errors in your plot.  Be sure to label your plot and give it an informative title.

5. Why might the estimated relationship between child mortality and women's education you estimated above be biased? Even though this is the data science section, draw on at least one of the course readings to support your argument.

6. Using her spouse's education as an instrumental variable for a woman's education, perform two stage least squares.  Display the results of your second stage in a table that meets the same criteria as the table you created in 3.

7. Write one paragraph discussing how the results you found in your OLS and two stage least squares regressions (#2 and #5) relate to the theoretical model(s) learned in the course. Think of this as a practice run for your paper.
